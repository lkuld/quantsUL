##  Functions

We have already applied and even written our own function in the first tutorial. In this tutorial, we take a more in-depth look at functions and learn how to apply multiple functions efficiently to subset data and caculate group-specific statistics.

Recall the function from the first tutorial. $f$ calculates a numerical output depending on a variable input $x$: $f(x)=4x+3$. 


```{r FunktionBsp, exercise=TRUE}

linearFunction <- function(x){
  4*x + 3
}

linearFunction(x =2)
linearFunction(2)
```

This function has one argument, called x. We can easily write a function with two arguments, for instance the mean of two numbers called red and blue. f(red, blue)= (red + blue)/2. 

If we do not want perform all calculations in one line, we can save intermediate results as done in the function `mean2` below. These intermediate objects are only created within the function environment and will not appear outside the function.

```{r f2, exercise=TRUE}

mean2 <- function(red, blue){
  sum <- red+blue
  mean <- sum/2
  mean
}

mean2(red=2, blue = 4)
```

If you want to find out what a function does or what arguments it takes, just type ?function, for instance `?log`, in the console. 

`log(x, base = exp(1))` calculates a logarithm with a specified base. Like many other functions, `log()` has a default setting for one of its arguments, that is the base is set to the `exp(1)` (Euler's number). 

Change the base to 10 in the box below.

```{r log, exercise=TRUE}

log(5)
```
```{r log-solution}

log(5, base = 10)
```
## Pipelines

Often, we want to apply more than one function  to a dataset. A common case might be to first subset the data and then calculate a statistic. If we do not want to save all intermediate results, we can apply multiple functions at once. To make this approach more readable, the pipeline operator helps to separate out the different steps/functions.

In the example below, we first change a vector to numeric, then calculate the natural logarithm of each number, and finally calculate the mean.

```{r f3, exercise=TRUE}

vec <- c('3', '5', '2', '8')
vec2 <- as.numeric(vec)
vec3 <- log(vec2)
vec4 <- mean(vec3)
vec4

mean(log(as.numeric(vec)))
```

The first approach is very long and we either have to overwrite our initial vector or create new objects. The second approach becomes difficult to read quickly.

An alternative approach would be to use a 'pipeline' operator. R has two pipeline operators, the relatively new base R operator `|>` and the older `%>%` from the `margittr` package (You will see both in online solutions). They are basically interchangeable.

The next box demonstrates the approach. The output of each step is used as the first argument in the next step, that is `x |> f(y)` is the same as `f(x, y)`. 

A quick way to type ` |> ` in RStduio is to press Ctrl, Shift and M at the same time (You can change in the settings (Code) whether you want the base or margittr pipeline operator). Type ?'|>' for more details.

```{r f4, exercise=TRUE}

vec <- c('3', '5', '2', '8')


m <- vec |>
  as.numeric() |> 
  log() |> 
  mean()
  
m


```

## dplyr

`dplyr` is a an R package for data manipulation that makes heavy use of the pipeline structure.^[See https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/ or vignette("dplyr") in R] In this chapter, we will only look at the main structure and principles. https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html provides a more in-depth introduction on the various functions and help.

Remember the cleaned Limerick housing data used in Tutorial 2, that is all property price data fromLimerick between 2018 and 2022.

```{r dat}
limerick_property_df
```

Usaing base R and `dplyr`, we will now calculate the mean price for all observations from 2019. (The package `dplyr` is already called here, you would have to use 
`library(dplyr)` first to replicate the code outside this tutorial.)

```{r f5, exercise=TRUE}

mean2019_base <- limerick_property_df[limerick_property_df$year == '2019', 'price'] |> 
  mean() 

mean2019_dplyr <- limerick_property_df |>
  filter(year == '2019') |> 
  summarise(mean = mean(price)) 

mean2019_base
mean2019_dplyr
```

`dplyr` makes code somewhat easier to read by making it more similar to natural language. This makes more complicated operations more approachable.

A very useful application of the `dplyr` structure is calculating statistics by group using the `group_by()` function. The following code calculates mean price and number of observations by year.

```{r f6, exercise=TRUE}

mean2019_dplyr <- limerick_property_df |>
  group_by(year) |> 
  summarise(mean = mean(price), n=n()) 

mean2019_dplyr
```

We can easily calculate more statistics by group and also add a filter. Can you calculate the (a) mean price, (b) median price, (c) price standard deviation, and (d) number of observations, each by year and only for observations under 500,000 euro?

```{r f7, exercise=TRUE}

```
```{r f7-solution}

under500k <- limerick_property_df |> 
  filter(price<500000) |> 
  group_by(year) |> 
  summarise(mean=mean(price), median=median(price), std.dev=sd(price), n=n())

under500k

```


Instead of creating a new data set for the summary statistics, you could replace the function `summarise` with `mutate` to add the new statistics as variables to the old data.frame. 

Use the box below to create a new logical `TRUE`/`FALSE` variable. The new variable, called 'expensive' should have the value true if the price is larger than the median price of the year.

```{r f8, exercise=TRUE}

```
```{r f8-solution}

limerick_property_df <- limerick_property_df |> 
  group_by(year) |> 
  mutate(expensive = price > median(price))

limerick_property_df

```

Run the tutorials ex-data-filter, ex-data-mutate, and ex-data-summarise in the `learnr` package for more tutorials on these operations. Type `learnr::run_tutorial(name = 'ex-data-filter', package = 'learnr')`, `learnr::run_tutorial(name = 'ex-data-mutate', package = 'learnr')`, or `learnr::run_tutorial(name = 'ex-data-summarise', package = 'learnr')`.
